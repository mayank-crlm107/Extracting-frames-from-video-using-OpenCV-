# Extracting-frames-from-video-using-OpenCV-
The frames will be extracted from the video mentioned in the code written in python using the OpenCV library. The video should also belong to the same directory as the code itself. The extracted frames are then stored in another folder in the same directory. 

Using OpenVC, take an mp4 file and produce a number of images.
OpenVC 3.2 needs to be installed.
